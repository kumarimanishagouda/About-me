# About-me
# 👋 Hi, I'm  Kumari Manisha Gouda  

Welcome to my GitHub profile! 🌟  

I’m passionate about working with **Python** to explore **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Data Science**.  
My journey started with **Excel and Statistics**, and today I enjoy combining those foundations with Python to build **intelligent solutions** and **data-driven web applications**.  

I believe learning is a continuous process — every project I share here is a step forward in that journey 🚀.
